I'm a postdoctoral researcher interested in semantic and pragmatic issues, both from a theoretical and an experimental perspective. I currently work with [Andrea E. Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/aemn1011/home), [Mark Blokpoel](http://www.markblokpoel.com/), and [Iris van Rooij](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com/) in the [Language in Interaction](https://www.languageininteraction.nl/) project at the Donders Institute of Brain, Cognition and Behaviour.
